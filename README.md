# 🏠 USA House Price Prediction

## 📊 Project Overview

This project investigates key factors influencing housing prices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, using a dataset of 856 properties collected in 2005. The analysis includes data exploration, statistical testing, and predictive modeling using **simple** and **multiple linear regression** techniques. It was completed as part of my MSc in Applied Data Science and emphasises real-world statistical modeling, interpretation, and communication of insights.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Explore and visualise relationships between property features and sale prices  
- Apply statistical tests (t-tests, chi-squared) to draw inferences  
- Build and interpret simple and multiple regression models  
- Evaluate model performance and conduct feature selection  
- Communicate findings clearly and accurately

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: R  
- **Packages**: `fastDummies`, `DescTools`, `caret`, `MASS`, `stats`  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Data visualisation  
  - Correlation analysis  
  - Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-squared test)  
  - Linear regression (log-transformed models)  
  - Feature selection using AIC and cross-validation

## 📈 Key Results

- **Log(area)** is a highly significant predictor: every 1% increase in area corresponds to a **1.03% increase** in sale price  
- Houses on the **waterfront** or with a **fireplace** were significantly more expensive  
- The final reduced regression model, built through **stepwise AIC selection**, outperformed the full model in terms of generalisability  
- **Presence of a pool**, interestingly, was *not* a significant price predictor  
- Statistical tests confirmed that waterfront homes have higher mean prices, and that pools and fireplaces are not independent features

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to apply statistical reasoning to real-world housing data  
- Importance of feature transformation (e.g. log-scaling) for linear modeling  
- Evaluating model fit and assumptions using residual plots  
- Trade-offs between model complexity and performance (AIC vs. RMSE)  
- Clear communication of technical findings through visualisations and narrative
